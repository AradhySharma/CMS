Mentor: Asit Prakash
Assigned to: Aradhy Sharma
Overview:
The CMS tool is a content management system designed to allow users of the same company to manage different types of content such as text, email, image, audio, and video. The tool provides various features such as authentication, drafting, publishing, and more to simplify the content management process.


Features:

User Authentication and Authorization:

In order to utilize any features offered by the platform, users are required to register and log in using their email and password. The platform consists of three distinct user roles, namely VIEWER, EDITOR, and PUBLISHER, each with varying degrees of access privileges. The ADMIN role grants complete access to all platform functions for a particular project, while the SUPERADMIN role provides access to all functions across all projects in the platform.

Roles, other than SUPERADMIN, are assigned on a per-project basis. When a user creates a project, they automatically become the admin and can assign different users from their company to different roles.

When registering, users must provide their name, current company, email address, and password. Additionally, the platform offers a "Forgot Password" feature for users who need to reset their login credentials.
